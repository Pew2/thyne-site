You are working on the Thyne Jewels website project.
Your task is to cleanly complete, optimize, and make the site production-ready for Apple Developer approval.
Follow instructions strictly. Do not invent business logic beyond what is specified.

1. Responsive Navigation (High Priority)

Fix the mobile navigation.

On small screens, the hamburger (burger) icon must:

Be visible

Open a dropdown or slide menu

Show links for:

Home

Wholesale

Journal

About

Ensure navigation works correctly across:

Mobile

Tablet

Desktop

No broken or hidden menu items at any screen size.

2. Footer Redesign (Replace existing footer completely)

Create a 4-column footer with the following structure:

Column 1: Company

Thyne Jewels Pvt. Ltd.

Address:
G5-1406, Eros Sampoornam, Sector-2, 
Patwari, Gautam Buddha Nagar- 201307, 
Uttar Pradesh, India

Column 2: Company Links

Home

Wholesale

Journal

About Us

(All links must work)

Column 3: Legal

Terms of Service (new page)

Privacy Policy (new page)

Privacy Policy must state:

No direct user data collection on this website

WhatsApp interaction is user-initiated

Third-party platforms govern their own data

Column 4: Contact

Email: care@thynejewels.com

Phone: +91 92116 33503

WhatsApp: click-to-chat link
https://wa.me/+919211633503

Social links (add/remove/update):

[add]Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thyne.fb
[edit]Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thyne.ai
[add]LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/thyne
remove-whatsapp, pinterest

Footer must be:

Responsive

Clean

Fully clickable

No dead links

3. Journal Section (Critical)

Keep the Journal section enabled.

On the Journal listing page:

Show article cards with image, title, short excerpt.

When a user clicks an article:

Open a dedicated article page

OR expand inline below the card (acceptable fallback)

Create at least 2–3 sample articles with:

Title

Body text (300–500 words, placeholder content is fine)

No article should lead to a dead end or blank page.

4. Images & Videos Handling

If any component currently shows an empty image or video:

Replace with neutral placeholder visuals (jewellery / abstract / lifestyle).

Use:

Public placeholder sources (e.g. Unsplash/Pexels), OR

Local placeholder assets (e.g. /assets/placeholder.jpg)

Clearly structure code so assets can be replaced later.

Do not leave empty media blocks.

5. Link Behavior Rules (Very Important)

Every clickable link on the site must do one of the following:

Redirect to https://thyne.ai

Open WhatsApp chat (https://wa.me/[NUMBER])

Open internal pages (Home, Journal, Article, About, Privacy, Terms)

Open social media links

❌ No button or link should do nothing
❌ No “coming soon” dead clicks

6. Legal Pages

Create these pages:

/privacy-policy

/terms-of-service

Use simple, clear language. No commerce, no payments, no refunds, no cancellations.

7. General Quality Requirements

Fully responsive across screen sizes

All screen size optimised poperly

No horizontal scroll

All text readable on mobile

All CTAs clickable

No console errors

8. Do NOT do the following

Do not add payment flows

Do not add login/signup

Do not add analytics unless already present

Do not invent backend APIs
